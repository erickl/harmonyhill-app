# Getting Started with Firebase
Make sure your node version is compatible with Firebase 11
- nvm install 20
- nvm use 20
- nvm alias default 20
Install and login to Firebase
- npm install -g firebase-tools
- firebase login
- firebase install
For the authentication flow
- npm install firebase-admin

# Launching on Firebase
- npm run build
- firebase deploy
- Once complete, you'll get a link like this: https://your-project-id.web.app, which you can share
- On Android, one can tap the 3-dot menu and chose "Add to Home screen", to make it almost like a real app

# Relaunch as APK for android
- edit the versionCode and versionName variables in android/app/build.gradle
- you need the key store password to be stored in the android/keystore.properties file. Ask the admin
- npm run build
- npx cap copy
Use this instead of "npx cap copy" when you changed anything related to Capacitor plugins or capacitor.config.ts/json
- npx cap sync
- Open in Android: npx cap open android
- Wait for Gradle to sync (see the progress bar finish at the bottom right)
- Create a release key (once): keytool -genkeypair -v -keystore android/app/hh-release-key.keystore -alias hh-release-key -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
